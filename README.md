what i want to do in this project? 

applying some skills with simple app idea 

app idea: 

- [x] basically having list of movies items 
- [x] store data locally
- [x] sort movies by highest or by lowest rate 
- [ ] user can rate movies
- [ ] start random rate movies at random times
- [ ] see movie details


we will use in the app the following : 
- TDD approach
- Unit testing (for sure)
- RecyclerView 
- RXJava 
- MVVM 
- ViewModel
- Realm 
- Data Binding

//unit testing are in android test as realm testing requires context to run with it
